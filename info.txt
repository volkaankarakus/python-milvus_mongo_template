A virtual environment is used to manage project-specific dependencies.
 This prevents the libraries your project uses from conflicting with the system-wide Python installation.
 You can create the virtual environment as follows:
** python3 -m venv venv  **

To activate this environment:
** source venv/bin/activate **


You can install the libraries required for your project using pip. For example, to install the requests library:
** pip3 install requests **

It is a good practice to list the libraries you have installed in a requirements.txt file.
 This file shows what dependencies others need to install when they clone your project.
  You can save dependencies in this file like this:
** pip3 freeze > requirements.txt **


To run this project, you can use the following command in your terminal:
** uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload **


Run in Browser:
When your application launches successfully,
 open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000/docs.
 FastAPI automatically generates Swagger documentation and you can view and test all routes of your API using this address.


Upload to GCP :
 Create a "requirements.txt" file containing the relevant dependencies.
 - main.py
 - requirements.txt
 - app/ (other files and folders of your app)
